title: "Python for JavaScript Developers"
---

So recently I began working at a little startup in New York City called
[Underdog.io](https://underdog.io), where I discovered that they had a back-end
written primarily in Python, a language that I had very little previous exposure
to.

While I was hired primarily for my experience with JavaScript and React, the
small size of our team means that I frequently have to delve into all parts of
the codebase in order to ship a feature. This meant that I had to get well
acquainted with Python, very fast.

Unfortunately, I had a hard time finding good resources for learning Python that
wasn't targeted to people who haven't programmed before. I already knew how to
program and am familiar with other languages, I just needed to learn the syntax
and paradigms of this one specific programming language, Python.

That's where this blog post comes in. To serve as a quick guide for JavaScript
developers who want to get up to speed quickly with Python, but without having
to learn what declaring a variable means.
