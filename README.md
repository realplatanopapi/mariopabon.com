My web home / blog, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Getting started

Before you can start development, you must have the following installed on your machine:

- Ruby v2.3+
- Jekyll v3.3+
- Node v6.10+

Once those are installed, install Ruby dependencies by running:

```
bundle install
```

Then install front end dependencies with npm by running:

```
npm install
```

After dependencies have finished installing, you can run a development script which will watch files and rebuild the site whenever a file changes:

```
npm run develop
```

Check out the [package.json](https://github.com/restlessbit/mariopabon.com/blob/master/package.json) in this repo for a full list of npm scripts.
