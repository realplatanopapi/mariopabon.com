## Getting started

Before you can start development, you must have the following installed on your machine:

- Node

Once those are installed, install development dependencies by running:

```
npm install install
```

After dependencies have finished installing, you can run a development script which will watch files and rebuild the site whenever a file changes:

```
npm run develop
```

Check out the [package.json](https://github.com/restlessbit/mariopabon.com/blob/master/package.json) in this repo for a full list of npm scripts.
