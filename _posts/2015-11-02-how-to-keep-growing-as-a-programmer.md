title:  "How to Keep Growing as a Programmer"

You wake up. Write some code. Go to sleep. Next day. Same thing. Every day. Same thing.

You start to feel burnt out. You forget why you even like programming. Things are starting to look bleak.

How do you keep yourself from burning out? How can one prevent this type of stagnation, and ensure that they keep growing as a software developer?

*Heads up: I’m a front end developer, so a few of my examples are biased towards web development (sorry). But the same topics apply regardless of programming language or software stack.*

### Learn to program

I don’t mean learn to write code in a specific programming language. I mean learn the fundamentals of computer science and software engineering. For instance, figure out how to integrate <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/introduction-to-javascript-unit-testing/" target="_blank">Unit Testing</a> into your workflow. Set up <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a> and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html" target="_blank">Continuous Delivery</a> with Git and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis</a>. Read up on <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/" target="_blank">software design patterns</a>. Learn how to write <a href="http://aspiringcraftsman.com/series/solid-javascript/" target="_blank">S.O.L.I.D.</a> code. Implement some <a href="https://github.com/nzakas/computer-science-in-javascript" target="_blank">data structures and searching/sorting algorithms</a>.

### Keep learning new things

Make a list of topics that you are weak on or know nothing about, and make an effort to learn more about them. Find some articles on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>, signup for a service like <a href="https://egghead.io/" target="_blank">Egghead</a>, or do some book shopping on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=lp_5_nr_n_13?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A283155%2Cn%3A%211000%2Cn%3A5%2Cn%3A3839&bbn=5&ie=UTF8&qid=1446508596&rnid=5" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.

### Hack on side projects

You can also use side projects as an opportunity to learn new things. Want to start writing Unit Tests? Or build an app with Ruby on Rails? There is nothing stopping you now. You have the freedom to do whatever you want.

The freedom that side projects provide can also be used an outlet for your day job. You can experiment with technologies that you don’t normally work with, and you will have total control over what you create, from the design to the code that you write.

### Acquire soft skills

There is more to being a developer than knowing how to write code. As humans, we must also learn how to communicate effectively with other humans. Learning to communicate with others will reduce confusion and frustration when interacting with other people, which will make you a much happier person, both at work and at home.

Dale Carnegie’s classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034" target="_blank">How to Win Friends & Influence People</a> is a great resource to get you started, as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617292397?psc=1" target="_blank">Soft Skills: The software developer’s life manual</a> by John Sonmez.

### Take part in extracurricular activities

There is more to life than code. If you do nothing but eat, sleep, and write code all day, you will lose your mind. Be sure to take a break every once in awhile. Go hiking. Workout (with our sedentary lifestyle, getting exercise is a necessity). Re-connect with old acquaintances. Write a bit. Read more. Do anything that keeps you from thinking about programming all day.

### Just keep things fresh

Growing is more than just about getting a better job or making more money. It is a way to keep things fresh and exciting, and to remind yourself why you got into programming in the first place: because it’s fun.
