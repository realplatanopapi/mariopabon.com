        <h1>Mario Pabon is a software engineer living and working in New York City.</h1>
        <p>
          I make apps and services, mostly with JavaScript and Python.

        <p>
          I believe we as a tech community can do better when it comes to matters of ethics, diversity, and inclusion, and intend to only use my skills to make things better for all rather than for a select few.
        </p>

          Currently working to make hiring in tech better at <a href="https://underdog.io" target="_blank">Underdog.io</a>.
